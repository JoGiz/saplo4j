Saplo4j
=======

This is a Java client for the Saplo API. It supports most saplo API functions, with a notable exception of the tagging library.

Most long-running methods support both synchronous and asynchronous behaviour. The asynchrounous version of the API allows for several thousand calls to be made simultaneously.
